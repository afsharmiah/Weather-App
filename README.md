Created a weather app by using Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3. 

I have added the following features in my app. 

1) search by city name
2) If the city name is correct
    showing
        >City Name
        > Date
        > Temperature
        > Condition
        > Feels Like
        > Humadity
        > Wind
3) If the city name is wrong
    showing
        > only showing Error msg: "Please enter a valid city" 

Thanks for being here.
